# Word Guess Game - Classical Composer Edition
This is my version of the Module 2 assessment. The game consists of 10 rounds where you guess the name of the famous classical composer.

This game was made using vanilla Javascript.

#How to play
Press any letter key on your keyboard to begin guessing the word. The word you have to guess will first display itself with underscores equal to the number of characters in the word.
Every time you answer correctly, the music from the composer you guessed will start playing and the song title will be displayed.
If you either lose your round or beat the game, will you have to refresh the page to play again.
